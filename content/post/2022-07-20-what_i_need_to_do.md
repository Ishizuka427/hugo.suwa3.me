I’ve been feeling unsettled lately. I have ups and downs, my rhythm is all over the place. I feel like it’s making me tired and distracting me from what I need to do. Or maybe I’m just looking for excuses to get away from what needs to be done.  

I feel like I know what I need to do, but it’s getting harder and harder every year to change myself. Thoughts become actions, so I want to be conscious of my thoughts in order to bring myself closer to my ideal, even if it is only little by little.  

- Don’t think about unnecessary things  
If I notice that I am thinking unnecessary thoughts, I change my location or posture.
- Create a to-do list  
Get in the habit of organizing
- Value my daily habits  
Be aware of routines such as getting up at a certain time, drinking coffee, brushing teeth, etc.

> Our method is inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin human memory model that has a sensory memory, a working memory, and a long-term memory.   

When I see technology develop again, inspired by and based on the brain mechanisms related to human memory, it seems to me that engineers are becoming more like biological experts, and I wonder if technology will eventually converge with humans (albeit with higher performance). Along with that, I feel that the mystique of living things will diminish.
