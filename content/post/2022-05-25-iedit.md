## What is iedit?
https://github.com/victorhge/iedit  
Tools for Bulk Editing  

## Install
`M-x package-list-packages`  
â†’ Select and install iedet  

## init.el
```init.el
;;iedit
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/iedit")
(require 'iedit)
```

## How to use
Press `C-;` at the point where you want to edit the batch. (It's default key bindings.)  
Then you will be in edit mode, and when you are done modifying, `C-;` again to finish editing.  

## Note
At first, I didn't know how to use it.
But I found it very useful to see what is going on in real time by looking at the `*Messages*`.  
  
I looked up what Spacemacs uses and it seems that `multiple cursors` is used. Which one was correct?  
  
By the way, I installed Magit the other day. I was worried at that time, too. I asked for advice on the #emacs channel at work. Everyone was using Magit. (Incidentally, it seemed that Magit was also used in Spacemacs.)  
  
There are many things I can do with Emacs. First, I want to use it as an editor. I want to add useful features for coding with emacs.
