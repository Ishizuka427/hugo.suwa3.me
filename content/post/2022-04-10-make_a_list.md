I have been very busy lately. Therefore, I couldn't write my blog. Finally, now that my busyness has calmed down, I would like to spend my weekends posting blogs and catching up on technology.  

- I updated my [MindMap](https://github.com/Ishizuka427/MindMap).
- I made a [list](https://butter-fuschia-2e9.notion.site/To-Do-88625f0133f94dbb99347c43f6be28d9) of technologies I want to know about. (by Notion)  
    
I started living with a dog last month. He is a puppy, but he will be quite large. The house I live in now allows dogs. But I decided to move.
