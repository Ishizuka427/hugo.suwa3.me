hugo.suwa3.me is based on Hugo and Vercel.

## How to Create A New post
You can use the `new` command to do.  
For example: When you write a blog with the title "example-title" on December 1, 2021
```sh
$ hugo new content/posts/2021-12-01-example-title.md
```
Set the following at the top of the blog.
```
---
title: "Example Title"
date: 2021-12-01T00:00:00.000Z
categories: 
  - "tech-blog"
  - "note"
tags:
  - "Tech"
  - "life"
---
```

Categories | Description
-- | -- 
tech-blog | When writing about technical content.
note | When writing about non-technical content.

Tags | Description
-- | -- 
Tech | When writing about technical content.

â€» I want to subdivide and increase the number of tag types in the future.
